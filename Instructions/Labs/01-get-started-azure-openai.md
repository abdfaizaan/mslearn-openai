# Lab 01: Get started with Azure OpenAI Service

## Estimated Duration: 80 Minutes

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you'll learn how to get started with Azure OpenAI by provisioning the service as an Azure resource and using the Azure AI Foundry portal to deploy and explore OpenAI models. The Azure OpenAI Service brings the generative AI models developed by OpenAI to the Azure platform, enabling you to develop powerful AI solutions that benefit from the security, scalability, and integration of services provided by the Azure cloud platform. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Task 2: Deploy a model
- Task 3: Use the Chat playground
- Task 4: Explore prompts and parameters 
- Task 5: Explore code generation

## Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource

In this task, you'll create an Azure resource in the Azure portal, selecting the OpenAI service and configuring settings such as region and pricing tier. This setup allows you to integrate OpenAI's advanced language models into your applications.

1. On the Azure portal, type **Azure OpenAI (1)** in the search box and select **Azure OpenAI (2)** from the results.

## Task 3: Use the Chat playground

In this task, you'll use the Chat playground to interact with and test the AI model's conversational abilities through a simulated chat interface.

1. From the left navigation pane, select the **Chat** section under the **Playground** and ensure that the **my-gpt-model (1)** model is selected in the Deployment pane.

2. In the **Setup** section, in the **Give the model instructions and context** box, replace the current text with the following statement **(2):**

   ```
   The system is an AI teacher that helps people learn about AI.
   ```
   
      ![](../media/my-gpt-model-1.png)

3. Select the **+ Add section (1)** box, then click on **Examples (2)**. Enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:

      ![](../media/dev-12.png)

4. Enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:

    - **User (1):**
      ```
      What are the different types of artificial intelligence?
      ```
    
    - **Assistant (2):**
      ```
      There are three main types of artificial intelligence: Narrow or Weak AI (such as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, image recognition software, and spam filters), General or Strong AI (AI designed to be as intelligent as a human being. This type of AI does not currently exist and is purely theoretical), and Artificial Superintelligence (AI that is more intelligent than any human being and can perform tasks that are beyond human comprehension. This type of AI is also purely theoretical and has not yet been developed).
      ```

      ![](../media/L1T4S4-1607.png)

      >**Note:** Few-shot examples are used to provide the model with examples of the types of responses that are expected. The model will attempt to reflect the tone and style of the examples in its own responses.

5. Save the changes by clicking on **Apply changes** and on **Update system message?** pop-up, click on **Continue**.

    ![](../media/L1T4S5-1607.png)
   
6. In the query box on the right side of the page, enter the text **(1)** as mentioned below. Use the **Send (2)** button to submit the message and view the response.

   ```
   What is artificial intelligence?
   ```

   ![](../media/L1T4S6-1607.png)

   > **Note:** You may receive a response that the API deployment is not yet ready. If so, wait for a few minutes and try again.

7. Review the response and then submit the following message to continue the conversation:

   ```
   How is it related to machine learning?`
   ```

8. Review the response, noting that context from the previous interaction is retained (so the model understands that "it" refers to artificial intelligence).

## Task 4: Explore prompts and parameters

In this task, you'll explore prompts and parameters by experimenting with different inputs and settings to fine-tune the AI model's responses and behavior.

1. In the **Setup** pane select **Parameters** , set the following parameter values:
    
   - **Temperature (1):** 0
    
   - **Max response (2):** 500

      > **Note:** You may need to scroll down to see the parameters option.

        ![](../media/L1T5S1-1607.png)
      
2. Submit the following message in the chat session

   ```
   Write three multiple-choice questions based on the following text.

   Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.

   - Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution, you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.

   - Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicles.

   - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors. 
   ```

3. Review the results, which should consist of multiple-choice questions that a teacher could use to test students on the computer vision topics in the prompt. The total response should be smaller than the maximum length you specified as a parameter.

4. Observe the following about the prompt and parameters you used:
   - The prompt specifically states that the desired output should be three multiple-choice questions.
   - The parameters include *Temperature*, which controls the degree to which response generation includes an element of randomness. The value of **0** used in your submission minimizes randomness, resulting in stable, predictable responses.

## Task 5: Explore code generation

In this task, you'll explore code generation by testing the AI model’s ability to generate and suggest code snippets based on various programming prompts and requirements.

1. In the **Setup** section, keeping the Deployments as **my-gpt-model (1)**; in the **Give the model instructions and context** box, replace the current text with the following statement: `You are a Python developer.` **(2)** and save the changes by clicking on **Apply Changes (3)**. When prompted with **Update system message?**, click **Continue** to proceed.

   ![](../media/L1T6S1-1607.png)

2. In the **Chat session** pane, select the **Clear chat** button, then select **Clear** in the **Clear chat?** pop-up window to clear the chat history and start a new session.

   ![](../media/L1T6S3-1607.png)

3. Submit the following user message:

   ```
   Write a Python function named Multiply that multiplies two numeric parameters.
   ```

4. Review the response, which should include sample Python code that meets the requirement in the prompt.

## Summary
